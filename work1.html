    <p><center><strong>Background:</strong> This case is about making a customer journey for Elbolaget AB (fictive case). In this study-case I present a persona created in another project as the typical customer. This customer journey includes five phases: discover, compare, consider, commit and retain. Customer journey is about collecting data and to summarize the experiences that customers go through when interacting with Elbolaget AB. The process of this -study-case includes interviews, observations of testing a prototype and collocation from the result of interviews and observations.

The prototypes used for this assignment was made in a team of UX-students in another course at IT-Högskolan.</center></p>

    <p><center><strong>My role:</strong> This assignment was made individual</center></p>

  <h2><strong>interview</strong></h2>
  <p>For this case I used the persona I created in another assignment. One phase in this assignment was to conduct an interview with this persona. As this persona is a fictive case I contacted a person that fitted in to characteristics of the persona. I conduced an interview and the person was asked questions regarding her relationship and interests about her electricity company, what is important for her when choosing electricity company and what a good contract includes. The questions I used were open-ended questions as my goal was to receive answers with more information than "yes" and "no".

What surprised me is that I thought I knew the answers before the interview, but what I realized was that I was wrong. An insight was suddenly clear to me - "People never think the way you think".</p>

<h2><strong>Observing</strong></h2>
<p>Phase two of this research was to let the person test prototypes for Elbolaget AB’s site. To see the prototypes - click here.

The person was asked to think out loud and click around on the site without any given instructions. I was present when the person was given the prototypes to test thereby I was able to read her body language, emotions and feelings while the person was interacting with the prototypes.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#727557;">The value of making a customer journey</h2>
    <p>Customer journey is best suited to support the work in identifying the times when the user is dissatisfied, to design a new service with a focus on user experience through various interaction points and to identify a vision for how service / touch points can change the user experience. A customer journey is shifting meaning that it can vary from one year to another.</p>

  <article class="article13">
    <h2 style="color:#727557;">How many step a customer is taking before making a decision</h2>
    <p>Before a customer goes trough from an idea to an actual decision, the customer must go trough many steps.
When the customer interacts with the company via social media, email, live chat or other channels, it can help to make a customer journey to be able to see where the customer encounters problems or what obstacles he has to be able to do what he wants on the page.</p>

<article class="article14">
<h2 style="color:#727557;">How to make a customer journey</h2>
<p>Making a customer journey is very useful to understand customers, what they need and how they behave.
As a UX-designer a customer journey has many benefits, for instance to understand the differences in buyer personas as they move from a prospect to conversion in the buying process.
By making a customer journey it helps visualize the process of the customer graphically.</p>
